# Analyze-Taylor-Swift-Lyrics-with-Python
Overview
On October 21, 2022 at midnight, Taylor Swift released her new album, Midnights. We wanted to know if she had dropped any hints about it before it went live, so we analyzed all of her lyrics. In this project, you will explore her references to ‘midnight’ leading up to this point, then you’ll expand your search to track her references to day, night, and time in general.

Then you will use sentiment analysis to study her tone and vibe over the course of her career. Then you’ll put it all together to determine if she writes more favorably about day or night. Throughout the whole project, you’ll get to practice your nlp and text analysis skills on a real corpus.
