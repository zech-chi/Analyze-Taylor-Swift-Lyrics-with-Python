midnights,maroon,2,When the morning came,1
midnights,maroon,2,We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf,2
midnights,maroon,2,Cause we lost track of time again,3
midnights,maroon,2,Laughing with my feet in your lap,4

midnights,maroon,2,"In New York, no shoes",11
midnights,maroon,2,Looked up at the sky and it was,12
midnights,maroon,2,The burgundy on my t-shirt,13
midnights,maroon,2,When you splashed your wine into me,14
midnights,maroon,2,And how the blood rushed into my cheeks,15
midnights,maroon,2,"So scarlet, it was",16
midnights,maroon,2,The mark thеy saw on my collarbone,17
midnights,maroon,2,The rust that grew bеtween telephones,18

midnights,maroon,2,"So scarlet, it was maroon",20
midnights,maroon,2,When the silence came,21
midnights,maroon,2,"We were shaking, blind and hazy",22
midnights,maroon,2,How the hell did we lose sight of us again?,23
midnights,maroon,2,Sobbing with your head in your hands,24
midnights,maroon,2,Ain't that the way shit always ends?,25

midnights,anti hero,3,"I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror",15
midnights,anti hero,3,It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero,16
midnights,anti hero,3,"Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby",17
midnights,anti hero,3,And I'm a monster on the hill,18
midnights,anti hero,3,"Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city",19
midnights,anti hero,3,"Pierced through the heart, but never killed",20
midnights,anti hero,3,Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism,21
midnights,anti hero,3,Like some kind of congressman?,22
midnights,anti hero,3,(A tale as old as time),23

midnights,anti hero,3,I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money,33
midnights,anti hero,3,She thinks I left them in the will,34
midnights,anti hero,3,The family gathers 'round and reads it,35
